## Computer strategy
You can play a few games first and try to guess how the computer thinks.

I wrote a strategy for the computer based on research on this game (you can search for articles). There are three cases:

1. **The computer loses**. He uses a "win-stay, lose-shift" strategy. So he changes his play, to the one that will win, to which he failed. Because usually people don't change their actions if they win.
3. **The computer won**. The same "win-stay, lose-shift" strategy, but a bit more complicated. The computer will choose the action that will win the player's action if player plays the "win-stay, lose-shift" strategy. x_x
4. **Draw**. Most people prefer rock. Therefore, the computer will choose paper. :D

P.s. and it can play completely randomly if you want it to.
